CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is a **critical component** in a DevOps engineer's job role and is frequently discussed in interviews. When explaining a CI/CD pipeline you've implemented, it's best to start with the Version Control System and the target platform.

Here's a breakdown of the process described in the sources:

1.  **Source Code Management:** The process begins when a user makes a **code commit** to a **Version Control System (VCS)**. This VCS is typically based on Git, using platforms like **GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket**. The code commit often involves a **pull request review** before the commit is finalized in the repository.

2.  **Orchestration and Triggering:** An orchestrator, such as **Jenkins**, is used to manage the pipeline. A **Git web hook** is configured to trigger the Jenkins pipeline automatically whenever there is a code commit to the Git repository.

3.  **Continuous Integration (CI) Stages (Orchestrated by Jenkins):** Jenkins executes the continuous integration part of the pipeline, which involves multiple stages. The stages are           typically defined in a **Jenkinsfile**, often using the **declarative Jenkins pipeline** style, which is preferred over scripted pipelines for better collaboration. The stages            include:
    *   **Checkout:** The first stage where the code, including the latest commit, is checked out from the Git repository.
    *   **Build and Unit Testing:** In this stage, the application code is built (e.g., using **Maven for Java applications**) and **unit test cases** are executed. Static code analysis,         linting, or formatting can also be performed here, depending on the use case.
    *   **Code Scanning:** This stage involves scanning the code for **security vulnerabilities** or further **static code analysis**. Tools like **SonarQube** can be used for this.
    *   **Image Building:** Since the target platform is **Kubernetes**, a **container image** (like a Docker image) is built using a **Dockerfile** located in the Git repository.
    *   **Image Scanning:** The newly built image is scanned to verify that it is **free from vulnerabilities**, checking the base image and any binaries or packages used.
    *   **Image Push:** Finally, the built and scanned image is **pushed to an image registry**, such as **Docker Hub, Quay.io, or AWS ECR**.

4.  **Transition to Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Once the new image version is available in the registry after the CI stages are completed, the next step is to get this image        deployed onto the target Kubernetes platform.

5.  **Updating Manifests:** The new image version is used to **update the Kubernetes YAML manifests or Helm charts** that define the application's deployment on Kubernetes. These updated     manifests or charts are then typically **pushed to a Git repository**. This repository can be the same as the source code repository or, preferably, a separate repository dedicated       to storing image manifests or charts.

6.  **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) using GitOps or Scripting:** The final stage involves deploying the changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Preferred GitOps Approach:** The recommended approach is using a **GitOps tool** like **Argo CD** or Flux CD. Argo CD is configured to **continuously watch the Git repository** 
        containing the updated Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. Whenever a new commit with the updated manifests is made to this repository, Argo CD **automatically pulls** the               changes and **deploys** them to the Kubernetes cluster. A key advantage of GitOps is that it makes **Git the single source of truth**. GitOps is also beneficial for managing               multiple Kubernetes clusters.
    *   **Alternative Scripting Approach:** If GitOps is not used or the user is uncomfortable with it, the deployment can be handled using scripting within the same Jenkins pipeline.             This involves using **shell scripts, Python scripts, or Ansible** along with tools like the **`kubectl` binary or `helm` command** to apply the updated manifests or charts to             the Kubernetes cluster. Ansible has an advantage when deploying to multiple platforms or clusters.

In **summary**, a typical CI/CD pipeline explained for an interview starts with a code commit to Git, which triggers a Jenkins pipeline for Continuous Integration (checkout, build, test, scan code, build and scan image, push image to registry). The new image version is then used to update deployment manifests (like YAML or Helm charts) in a Git repository. Finally, a Continuous Delivery/Deployment stage uses a GitOps tool like Argo CD to automatically deploy these changes from the manifest repository to the Kubernetes cluster whenever updates occur, or alternatively, scripting (Ansible, shell, Python) is used to apply the changes.
